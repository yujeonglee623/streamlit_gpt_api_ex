[00:00:00 --> 00:00:02]
So today, we're talking about these annoying spam calls that are coming relentlessly.

[00:00:02 --> 00:00:04]
This is a final compilation video summarizing ways to completely block them.

[00:00:04 --> 00:00:07]
Seriously, nowadays, even calls from numbers starting with 010 are coming in so frequently that falling for them once or twice is not uncommon.

[00:00:07 --> 00:00:08]
Since we're short on time, let's get straight to the first point.

[00:00:08 --> 00:00:11]
These somewhat legitimate calls are due to agreeing carelessly to certain options when signing up for memberships without much thought.

[00:00:11 --> 00:00:14]
But these cases are actually easy to block.

[00:00:14 --> 00:00:17]
You can simply search "Do Not Call" on the internet like now.

[00:00:17 --> 00:00:19]
Then, two identical websites will appear.

[00:00:19 --> 00:00:22]
The site ending with ".or.kr" is for blocking calls from banks, insurance companies, and financial institutions.

[00:00:22 --> 00:00:24]
And the other one ending with ".gio.kr" is for blocking telemarketing and sales calls.

[00:00:24 --> 00:00:27]
You just need to enter each site and select "Do Not Call Registration" and "Request for Call Blocking" respectively.

[00:00:27 --> 00:00:29]
The second point is about election or opinion survey spams.

[00:00:29 --> 00:00:31]
This one is much simpler.

[00:00:31 --> 00:00:33]
Just make one call to the number you see now, customized to your telecommunication provider.

[00:00:33 --> 00:00:36]
Say, "Hello. I don't want to receive your calls."

[00:00:36 --> 00:00:38]
Then, an automated response will come up, and you won't receive those calls anymore.
